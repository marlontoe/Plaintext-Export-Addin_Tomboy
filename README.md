# Tomboy-Plaintext-Export-Addin

The Plaintext export add-in for Tomboy Notes allows you to export
all your notes or a selected notebook to plain .txt files, using the export functions introduced in Tomboy 1.7.1 on Linux and 1.9.7 on Windows and Mac. (In other words you must have that version or higher for it to work!) Itâ€™s licensed under the LGPL.
